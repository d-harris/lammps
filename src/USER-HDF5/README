The HDF5 package adds a dump_hdf5 command that allows for parallel HDF5 dumps.

Using this package requires that the TyphonIO format library for HDF5 
as well as HDF5 version 1.8.x are downloaded and installed on your system.
zlib is also required. The libaries can be installed in lib/hdf5 or elsewhere
on your system, which must be done before building LAMMPS with this package.

Details on the download, build and installation process for TyphonIO and the 
other libraries are given in the lib/hdf5/README file.

Once you have successfully built LAMMPS with this package and the TyphonIO
library you can test it using an input file from the examples dir:

./lmp_intel < lammps/examples/hdf5/in.obstacle.hdf5

The dump_hdf5 package was written by Duncan Harris (AWE plc).
