dump_hdf5 command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump_hdf5 ID group-ID hdf5 N file  args :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the dump :ulb,l
group-ID = ID of the group of atoms to be dumped - Currently must be set to 'all' :l
N = dump every this many timesteps :l
filename = name of file to write dump info to :l
           in the format 'name.h5' or just 'name'. Files are renamed to name.h5
           * can be used to specify one file per dump (the * is renamed to the current timestep)
           NOTE that .bin, .gz and % are NOT allowed in the filename.
args = list of atom attributes
    possible attributes = mesh_only, mass, vx, vy, vz, fx, fy, fz, q, c_ID, c_ID[N] 
      mesh_only = atom positions and types only (default if no attributes given)
      mass = atom mass
      vx,vy,vz = atom velocities
      fx,fy,fz = forces on atoms
      q = atom charge
      c_ID = per-atom vector calculated by a compute with ID
      c_ID[N] = Nth column of per-atom array calculated by a compute with ID

[Examples:]

dump   2b all hdf5 500 dumpfile
dump    1 all hdf5 500 dumpfile fx, vx, c_PE1
dump snap all hdf5 100 dump.hdf5.*.h5 mass fx fy fz c_Stress[2]

[Description:]

Dumps a snapshot of atom quantities to a parallel HDF5 file every N timesteps.
Periodic boundary conditions are applied.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The package does not currently allow for subsets of atoms to be dumped.
The dump interval, N, can be changed, as for a standard dump.
Dump filenames can contain one wildcard character.  If a "*"
character appears in the filename, then one file per snapshot is
written and the "*" character is replaced with the timestep value.
For example, dump.*.h5 becomes dump.0.h5, dump.10000.h5,

:line

Details of the attributes are given in the "dump"_dump.html command.

[Restrictions:]

This package does not allow for subsets of atoms to be dumped.
NOTE that .bin, .gz and % are NOT allowed in the filename.

This dump style is part of the USER-HDF5 package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.
